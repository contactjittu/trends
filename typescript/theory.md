<summary><b>Primitive types in TypeScript</b></summary>

In TypeScript, the primitive types are:

1. `boolean`: Represents true or false values¹.
2. `number`: Represents numeric values, including integers and floating-point numbers.
3. `string`: Represents a sequence of characters¹.
4. `symbol`: Represents a unique, non-numeric value¹.
5. `null`: Represents the absence of any value¹.
6. `undefined`: A variable that has not been assigned a value is `undefined`¹.
7. `bigint`: Can be used to store numbers too large to be stored in the `number` primitive, anything bigger than `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`.

These are the basic building blocks that serve as the foundation for more complex types and data structures in TypeScript. Always remember that TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, so it includes all JavaScript primitive types and adds a few extras for type safety.
